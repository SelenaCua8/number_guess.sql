Number Guessing Game 🎯🎲
This project, Number Guessing Game, was created as part of the FreeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification.
It involves building a simple game where users try to guess a randomly generated number, using SQL and Bash scripting. 🛠️💻
Through this project, I practiced working with databases, user input, and game logic.
